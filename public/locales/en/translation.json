  "bio": "ÙŒI graduated with a Bachelor's degree 21 years ago. Two years before graduating, I was introduced to the world of programming and began working on projects using Delphi and SQL. Over the next 15 years, I worked on various projects, including accounting systems, inventory management, and automation of leather manufacturing and textile factories.Later, I shifted to Python and JavaScript, and now I design all my projects using PostgreSQL, Node.js, Python, and React. I also have professional experience with data analysis tools such as Power BI, SSRS, and QlikView.Throughout my career, I have held various positions, including programmer, software production manager, and IT manager in different companies. Recently, I became acquainted with artificial intelligence, particularly ChatGPT, which has significantly increased my learning speed and product development. Additionally, I have a strong interest in the fields of blockchain and artificial intelligence.",
